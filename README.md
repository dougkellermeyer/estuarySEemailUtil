This repository covers the Solutions Engineers responsibilities and specifically some tooling/utils around how to answer customer questions.

Goals
- Document an end-to-end request (request, response, email formatting)
- Store that response as a manual or template for future automation
- (IF TIME) stand up a service that uses the manual template, Estuary's docs (https://docs.estuary.dev/), and any other examples responses (if available) to build a response that is ready to send to the customer
- (IF TIME, and I'm bored) - build a dashboard/FE for this service
